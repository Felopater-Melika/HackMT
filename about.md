BlueAid is a project designed to help with overly expensive medical bills.
Hospitals cut deals with insurance companies to charge them less money for
the same procedure. Fortunately, if you're uninsured and have a large bill,
you can often negotiate with the hospital to pay less.

This is where our project comes in: you take the itemized bill you recieve
from the hospital, take a picture of it, and then upload it to our site.
We'll then use an open source database of different costs for common procedures
to look up what the normal price is and compare it to what the hospital
is charging you. You can then take that information into negotiations to
ask for a lower price.
